                    Affirmative began at the 2023 +Tech Innovation Jam to tackle the time-intensive process faced by transgender healthcare navigators in finding suitable medical providers. We conducted thorough market research and user interviews, leading to the development of a dedicated resource hub tailored for the transgender community. Our product paid off with first-place wins in both the 2023 +Tech Innovation Jam and the 2024 Michigan Business Challenge, securing $20K in prizes. As a software engineer on the team, this experience was invaluable. I learned to collaborate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds, and it was incredibly rewarding to see my work appreciated in real life. This project also deepened my appreciation for the product development cycle, enhancing my skills and passion for software engineering.

                    Our project, Affirmative, originated during the 2023 +Tech Innovation Jam. It is inspired by a critical need identified by our founder, Sasha, who has firsthand experience navigating challenges in transgender health care. Recognizing the significant time burden faced by Trans Care Navigators in finding suitable medical providers, we conducted a pilot study over the summer of 2023. Our findings revealed that 85% of a navigator's time is spent on provider searches rather than direct client interaction exacerbated by the lack of centralized, transgender-specific resources. To address this pressing issue, Affirmative focuses on creating a dedicated resource hub tailored to the transgender community, aimed at streamlining access to essential health care services.

                    Throughout our journey with Affirmative, we undertook the entire product development cycle. This began with comprehensive market research and business analysis to understand the landscape and identify opportunities. We conducted extensive user interviews to gain insights into the needs and preferences of Trans Care Navigators, which informed our UI design process. The team collaborated on translating these insights into a user-friendly interface that would effectively address the challenges identified.

Personally, I took on the challenge of developing Affirmative from scratch, marking my first real-world project outside of academic settings. This involved learning HTML/CSS for frontend design, mastering JavaScript for interactive elements, setting up and managing a MySQL database for data storage, and utilizing Python Flask to build the backend infrastructure. The journey was both demanding and deeply rewarding. As this is my first project in the wild outside of schoolwork, I had to learn everything from scratch, but at the same time I felt like I learned so much more than sitting in lecture halls taking notes.

                <div class = "paragraph">
                    Our efforts culminated in significant achievements: we secured first place in the +Tech Innovation Jam among 50 competing teams and also emerged as champions in the 2024 Michigan Business Challenge, specifically in the social impact track. With those two competitions, we were able to get $20K prizes. Care navigators, crucial stakeholders in our project, appreciated the streamlined information and specific filters integrated into the website. Their positive feedback on the tailored user experience validated our approach.
The judges were impressed with our idea and expressed keen interest in its future technological developments. According to our model, Affirmative has the potential to reduce the time spent on finding a medical provider by 66%, showcasing its practical impact and scalability in addressing real-world challenges.

                    Our team comprises diverse backgroundsâ€”marketing, business, engineering, and design. This diversity was both our strength and our challenge. One challenge we encountered during the initial phase was to ensure effective collaboration and everyone is on the same page. We often assume other people know what we know and sometimes use jargon within our own field, which leads to less effective communication. 
<br><br>As the team's engineer, my role extended beyond coding to effectively communicating technical progress and challenges to non-technical team members. This became challenging when presenting our technical approach to the team, explaining my difficulties, or clarifying why seemingly simple UI designs are complex from an engineering perspective, as all these situations required translating technical terms into universally understandable language.
<br><br>To improve communication and collaboration, my colleague and I focused on simplifying our language, avoiding technical jargon, and using analogies to explain concepts. We also shifted our discussions to be results-oriented, showing outcomes rather than detailing processes. When addressing issues, we briefly mentioned the problem area, like the database, and provided a clear timeline for resolution, avoiding overly technical explanations. These strategies enhanced team alignment and facilitated smoother interactions across various skill levels and backgrounds.

                    This project was invaluable as my first real-world endeavor beyond classroom assignments, with actual users relying on our work. Building a product in real life proved far more challenging than following structured project specs in my EECS classes. I collaborated with Irene, the UI/UX designer, to develop the platform, discovering that creating a recommendation system is only part of the equation; user experience is crucial too. Decisions like the placement of the search bar and the selection of filter options needed careful consideration to be intuitive.

<br><br>Working on this project gave me a real taste of human-centered design. During user interviews with Justin, a transgender healthcare navigator with 5+ years of experience, I learned a lot about the community's challenges. When I showed him our prototype, he said, "If you can make this happen, I would pay a $20/month subscription fee." That really touched me and motivated me to see the project through. This experience showed me how to combine technical skills with empathy, and I aim to become a software engineer who focuses on creating meaningful, user-friendly solutions.
