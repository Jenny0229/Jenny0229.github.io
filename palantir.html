                    After two rounds of interviews, I was thrilled to join the Palantir Launch 2024 Program in Washington, DC. It was an incredible journey where I spent a week at the DC office, participated in panel sessions, connected with coworkers, and learned about the company's diverse roles. I delved into Palantir's AIP and Foundry platforms, culminating in a project that allocated vaccines worldwide using Foundry.<br><br>
What I love about Palantir is the diversity of backgrounds among the people and the opportunities to work in various fields. My peers were amazing, and I learned so much from them. This experience has been one of the most valuable of the year.

                            Palantir has identified a unique niche in technology that essentially every industry and big company needs. Its core of collaborating with customers from different fields gives workers the chance to dive into different industries and learn something new every day. As someone who is adaptable and enjoys exploring different fields, I find this particularly appealing. Palantir‚Äôs projects span from allocating healthcare resources during COVID-19 to working with Ferrari and airlines. This flexibility excites me, as it provides the opportunity to continuously learn and engage in diverse, meaningful work. </li>

Another thing I love about Palantir is the mix of people from all sorts of backgrounds. There's a guy who graduated from Columbia with a degree in social science and psychology, and now he's working as a Delta here. There's also a girl who studied at Nirwana, a dream university of mine, with students from all over the world. Palantir isn't your typical tech company where everyone has a computer science degree. I really appreciate how inclusive and diverse the office is‚Äîit creates an awesome vibe.

I've always been passionate about human-centered design and people-first engineering. What I love about Palantir, especially as a Delta (Forward Deployment Software Engineer), is the focus on creating real products that immediately help customers. 
<br>During a mentoring session, I spoke with someone who had worked as a software engineer for a famous insurance company for many years before joining Palantir. He mentioned that, in his previous role, he often implemented functions that no one cared about or used. At Palantir, you get immediate feedback from customers and engage in back-and-forth conversations to improve the product. I really like seeing the things I create being used by people and making a real impact.

                            </div>
                            After the first day, I only had one feeling in my mind: overwhelmed. As an introvert, meeting so many new people in such a packed schedule was daunting. What struck me most was how talented my peers were. Many came from top schools or had interned at prestigious companies. Out of the ~20 people in my cohort, four were from Harvard, and several others were from other Ivies. When they talked about their summer plans, names like Meta, Figma, JP Morgan, and Deloitte were casually mentioned while I felt ashamed out of nowhere. I thought I was not as talented, and even thought my acceptance to the program was a coincidence. <br><br>
                            
                            However, as I worked alongside my peers, I realized they were incredibly kind and I could learn a lot from them. While I still felt out of place at times, it got better as I focused on learning from them. I noticed that when Palantir employees introduced new technologies, the only thing in my mind was ‚ÄúOMG that was amazing‚Äù while my peers could think critically and ask questions whenever they felt it didn't make sense. Their critical thinking inspired me, and I became friends with them, realizing they weren't scary after all. <br><br>
                            
                            On my last day I was waiting for my uber in the front desk on the first floor. Though it sounds like inspirational fluff and cheesy, it‚Äôs actually real: when chatting with the security guy, I told him about my program there and my feelings. He looked at my eyes and said "don't you ever look down at yourself". Those words touched me deeply and helped m

                                    Solving Open-ended Problems: 
                                </div>
In my classroom setting, I'm often accustomed to close-ended problems. Even when the tasks are challenging, there's always a clear specification on how to approach the project or solve the problem, and there's typically one correct answer. However, real life is rarely so straightforward, and Palantir taught me how to tackle open-ended problems. <br><br>
During the program, we worked on an open-ended problem of allocating vaccine resources to different parts of the world for various diseases. Each disease had its own mortality rate, each vaccine had different efficacy, and multiple labs around the globe were producing these vaccines. Within a limited time, we had to decide on our approach and balance various trade-offs. For example, should we assume that the spread rate of a disease is consistent during an outbreak, or should we allocate vaccines based on country or pure population density?<br><br>
These open-ended questions required us to think critically and make decisions rather than simply following instructions. I found this type of problem-solving incredibly stimulating and rewarding.
