                    In the past academic school year, I was honored to join Microsoft's TEALS (Technology Education and Learning Support) program, a philanthropic initiative dedicated to making computer science education accessible for students who are excluded due to factors such as race, gender, or geography. After successfully completing a round of interviews, I began my role as a teaching assistant at Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy.
 <br><br>
 As a teaching assistant, I played a key role in supporting the Intro to Computer Science class. This class adopted Microsoft's MakeCode Arcade curriculum, which teaches students to use block-based coding to develop fun games. My responsibilities included coordinating class activities, ensuring that the lessons ran smoothly, and providing individual support to students.

                <div class = "paragraph">
                    Communicating with students was a big challenge for me, especially since all the students were online. They were quite shy at first, and when we initially met, they would always say they didn't have any questions whenever I asked. This reminded me of my own high school days as an introvert, where I would often say I didn't have any questions, even when I did. <br><br>

                    Recognizing this, I realized that I needed to create a comfortable and trusting environment where the students feel more at ease to speak up. I started by actively engaging them in casual conversations, sharing a bit about myself, and encouraging them to share their interests outside of class. I also made a point of asking more specific and open-ended questions related to the material, which made it easier for them to articulate their thoughts. <br><br>
                    
                    These efforts were incredibly helpful in breaking down the communication barriers. Over time, the students became more comfortable and started to open up, asking more questions and acting more active in class discussions. I was proud to see them grow in confidence, knowing that my efforts to connect with them had made a difference.

Surprisingly, I found that I learned quite a bit from my students as well. On the technical side, I gained a solid understanding of block-based coding through the MakeCode Arcade curriculum. This was my first experience with block-based coding, and I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging it was. Far from being boring, it helped me appreciate the importance of encapsulation and abstraction—skills that involve breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable blocks and solving sub-problems efficiently. <br><br>

Beyond the technical aspects, teaching the students felt like I was guiding a younger version of myself, and I truly enjoyed the experience. There was one memorable moment when a boy in the class found the MakeCode exercises too easy and asked for a more challenging task. After discussing with the other volunteers, we decided to introduce him to Python, which he absolutely loved. Seeing his excitement was incredibly rewarding, and it reminded me of the joy of discovering something new and challenging.
